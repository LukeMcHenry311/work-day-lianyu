## Struggles
My biggest struggle for this assignment was jquery, honestly it's just been a long time since i've used it. It almost felt like a step back after making a react porfolio, another struggle i had that i actually couldn't find a solution to was getting the buttons to work. if you look in the script.js from line 78-81 you can actually see what my solution idea was, turns out no so easy in practice. I would have liked to spend more time on this assignment however the bootcamp is almost over so i decided i'd turn it in and come back to it if i have the time later.
